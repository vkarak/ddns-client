# ddns-client
A dynamic DNS client for dyndns.org.

This is a dynamic DNS client I have developed some years ago, which I use to update DNS information on my local servers. The client code is accompanied by a standard Debian init script, so that you can run the client as a daemon. I have been using this client for the past years without any stability problems.
